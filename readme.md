## AttachMe - IntelliJ debugger plugin


#### Features

- AttachMe will attach the IntelliJ debugger automatically even if you start your app from terminal (or any other way).
You don't need to trigger `Attach to process` action manually.
- If you have a complex process hierarchy with many parent/child processes,
AttachMe can auto-attach to all the newly forked child JVM processes.
The behaviour will be similar to `set follow-fork-mode child` in the GDB debugger.
